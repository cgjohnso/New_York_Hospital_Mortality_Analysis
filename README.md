# New_York_Hospital_Mortality_Analysis
Examining reported deaths in New York Hospitals from SPARC 2019 Discharge Data

## Business Problem
Local news reporting an unfortunate inpatient care incident has prompted state health officials to review all hospitals for discharges resulting in mortality, and identify potential systemic problems. They want to know the types of patients coming into facilities, the conditions they present with, and the main factors contributing to mortality. The aim of the study is to prepare a report on recommendations to increase hospitalsâ€™ accountability for the care they deliver, and establish resources to support health facilities. The healthcare analytics division must review inpatient hospitalizations, gathering any necessary outside data, and reporting back our findings.

## Results

For this project I use TSQL joins, delete and update clauses, case statements, aggregate functions, window functions, and bulk insert to ingest, clean and explore data to discover, and answer research questions within a Microsoft SQL Server database hosting the SPARCS2019 Hospital Discharge dataset. I use Notepad++ to help locate invisible characters interfering with data ingestion. Tableau is used to visualize findings from the analysis, and build a final report.

## Methodology

We will follow tried and true data science work flow beginning with data preparation where we will collect the data set, discuss any limitations, import it into Microsoft SQL Server, review the data quality, and clean it before moving on to exploratory data analysis (EDA). 
During EDA we will find out basic information about the data through summary statistics, note any observations to help develop our research questions, and determine if further transformations to the data set are needed for data analysis. 
In the Data Analysis stage, we will interpret the findings, share the results through tableau, and wrap up with our take away conclusions.
